Hey, I'm Vicente!

I'm a computer science student and absolutely in love with the area. I'm mostly interested in developing games, so that's one thing that you'll certainly find here. I also really enjoy any kind of software development, cloud computing and automations with Ansible. I usually share interesting college assignments or anything I'm currently studying at the moment. I'm updating or uploading new repos whenever I can.
