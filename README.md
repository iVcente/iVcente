Hey, I'm Vicente!

I'm a computer scientist and one absolutely passionate about this field of study. I work as a game programmer and I love making games, so that's one subject to certainly find here! I try to share anything I'm currently studying at the moment. I'm updating or uploading new repos whenever I can.

ðŸ“« You can contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vicente-danzmann-vivian/);

ðŸ“„ I really enjoy documenting stuff that I learn about Unreal Engine and game development. I have this [Notion website](https://danzmann.notion.site/25520184d8894f318be2da8335e2cd66?v=291d059f4a6a41df91d8136d0230e805&pvs=4) where I gather smart people knowledge and also write on it mostly to my future self, but perhaps you can find it useful as well.
